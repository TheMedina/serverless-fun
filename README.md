# serverless-fun
AWS recently released a learning path documenting the creation of a Unicorn ride service known as Wild Rydes. While the learning path (found at https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/serverless-web-app/) is great at helping users understand the high level concepts of serverless architecture and the nitty gritty details of provisiong API gateways, DynamoDB tables, etc. it wasn’t very ‘real world’ friendly. This document aims to take the learning path a step up utilizing a few bash scripts, and the Serverless Framework to emulate a real world workflow. As a note I would strongly recommend completing the learning path as intended, then come back and revisit this page. That will give you a greater appreciation for how powerful and easy the Serverless Framework truly is.
